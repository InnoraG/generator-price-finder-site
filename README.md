## Installation ##

Assuming Node is installed, run the following command to install Yeoman and
the generator:

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g generator-price-finder-site
```

## Generate Site ##

From the root of the price-finder project directory, execute the following command:

```bash
$ yo price-finder-site
```

Follow the prompts to create the new Site, along with a unit and e2e test.
This will generate the files and most of their content, but some tweaking is
still required. Be sure to look through the files generated and update accordingly.
